# CodeForDurhamAffordableHousingDataSet

I am to create a bar chart based on the [https://github.com/JamieBort/CodeForDurhamAffordableHousingDataSet/blob/master/SourceFiles/nccountiespopprcchng1017.csv](.csv file) that Jim McManus emailed to me. (email found here: https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#search/Jim%40danugroup.org/16444468bf046c67)

To that end I am using the following resources:

and

If I use others I'll post them below.
