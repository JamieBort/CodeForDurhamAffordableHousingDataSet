# CodeForDurhamAffordableHousingDataSet

I am to create a bar chart based on the [.csv file](https://github.com/JamieBort/CodeForDurhamAffordableHousingDataSet/blob/master/SourceFiles/nccountiespopprcchng1017.csv) that Jim McManus emailed to me. (email found here: https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#search/Jim%40danugroup.org/16444468bf046c67)

To that end I am using the following resources:
https://scrimba.com/p/pb4WsX/cN8NmSm
and 
https://www.codeanalogies.com/d3garden

If I use other resources I'll post them below.
